Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a rising concern among health care professionals, driving them to search for alternative therapies. In the past few years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted lot of attention as substitute for conventional antibiotics. AMPs are naturally present in all organisms and play a vital role in their innate immunity. Our project successfully classifies peptides into various labels so as to understand the type of activity the peptide has and to help pharmacists and genomic scientists to model drugs which can work towards eliminating diseases. It also helps drive reproducible research in drug discovery. Classification will be based on sequence data provided of each peptide as input. The final output will be a web application which classifies peptides as antiviral, antimicrobial or antifungal or a combination of the three. The developed application makes the work of drug discovery easier and helps scientists conduct research free of cost.
